I finally hit "deploy" - www.ravjothbrar.com

A personal portfolio is typically the sort of project that is forever one more edit away from completing.
This time, I utilised Claude Code to truly bring the site to life.
Taking inspiration from more retro-ASCII style websites and blending it with a clean, static, purple UI allowed me to move from concept to implementation at astonishing speed.

What's inside:
- A look at my latest projects
- A glance at my past roles
- A peak into my technical and philosophical background
- A new blog - a space to streamline AI thoughts, useful practices, and ethical deliberations on recent advancements

If you have a moment, I'd love for you to take a look!
Feedback is always welcome.
